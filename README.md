# Thoughts on OMSCS so far (Jan 2016)

## How Courses are Run

Each course has been a little different but the main breakdown is this.

* Udacity - Hosts video lectures and quizzes, may include problem sets
* T-Square - Announcements, Assignments, Exams, Syllabus and other resources
* Piazza - Classroom forum, Office Hours, Announcements, Assignment/Material/General Discussion
* PeerFeedback (only some courses) - Students give feedback on other students' work

## The Courses I've Taken

* High Performance Computer Architecture (HPCA)
  * Very cool detailed dense coverage of material including
    * Instruction Pipelining
    * Branch Prediction
    * Instruction Scheduling
    * Caches
    * Virtual Memory
    * Memory, Storage, and Fault Tolerance
    * Multi-processing
    * Coherence and Synchronization
    * Many Cores

* Computer Vision (CV)
  * Very linear algebra and probability heavy coverage of material including
    * Edge Detection
    * Hough Transform for Lines, Circles, and the General Case
    * Fourier Transform, Frequency Domain, and Aliasing
    * Perspective Imaging (Stereo, Calibration, Projection)
    * Harris Corners, SIFT, RANSAC for Feature Detection
    * Lucas Kanade, Kalman Filter, Particle Filter for Feature Tracking
    * Generative Models, Discriminative Classifiers (SVM, HMM), PCA, Boosting
    * Segmentation

These courses were run fairly differently in that CV had almost weekly assignments (python, opencv) and a final (mostly multiple choice and T/F), while HPCA had 3 projects (C++), two midterms, and a final (mostly heavy calculations with some T/F and fill-ins).

I found that there was a lot of activity and support on CV's piazza compared to HPCA, but the lectures of both courses used intermittent quizzes to test understanding of general concepts. CV occasionally had quizzes involving basic programming tasks in Octave.

## The Courses I'm Taking

* Computational Photography (CP)

  This course seems to be run essentially like CV. It seems this one is a bit of a precursor to CV. Both courses are currently run by the same professor, though the video lectures for CV feature a different professor. One difference I've noticed so far in CP is the use of Peer Feedback.

* AI for Robotics (Robotic Car)

  This course seems a little strange to me so far. There are problem sets consisting of quizzes in Udacity that must be completed by a certain date, but the quizzes include follow-ups with answers, and students can go back and resubmit answers as many times as they like, so it seems to be just a check that students are up-to-date with the class. That said, it seems that there is not a lot of lecture material for this class. The first lecture seems to constitute 2 weeks of material, not 1, which was surprising to me.

## Overall Impression So Far

I am liking the program so far. For the first semester, I was a little behind in the material and felt that I was always playing catch-up. Also the two courses I was taking seemed to have a bit of a reputation for having a lot of work, though I'm sure many of the courses in the program do as well.

It seems to me that it is up to students to make sure they get the most out of these courses. Each class seems to have some people who are very active on Piazza talking about the material, related topics, news in the field, etc., so the program is a good opportunity to engage with people from many different places with like interests. I hope more courses are like HPCA in that it was very dense but clear in communicating material that was entirely new to me, and I came aware from that course with a better working knowledge and appreciation for that material.

One challenge I've personally had is getting used to the independence the program allows. It's up to me to take time to watch the lectures, work on the assignments, engage in the forum, etc. There is no scheduled time and place set aside to force me to stay on top of things, but since the first semester, I've become better at managing that.
